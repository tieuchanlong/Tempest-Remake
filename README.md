# Tempest-Remake
This is a remake of the game called Tempest 1981 with additional features using OpenGL and Glut.
This project is used for the Ubisoft Next 2020 Submission.

## Features
* Implement 2D graphics using OpenGL and Glut library
* Implement Singleton system for game settings
* Apply dynamic memory allocation, objected-programming inheritance, delegation, structs

## Challenges
The biggest challenge in this project was getting used to the OpenGL interface, which is highly required in the game industry, and at the same time very hard to learn. Currently, the legacy mode of OpenGL is a better option and I got used to it a month before Ubisoft Next 2020 Challenge. 

## Programming Lanaguage
C++

## Major Components
* OpenGL

## Innovation
There is further plan to convert this project into modern OpenGL usage and improve the graphic with texture and sound effects.
